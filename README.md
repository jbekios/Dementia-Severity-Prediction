# Application of Machine Learning Techniques for Dementia Severity Prediction from Psychometric Tests in the Elderly Population.

Previous research has shown the benefits of early detection and treatment of dementia. This detection is usually performed manually by one or more clinicians based on reports and psychometric testing. Machine learning algorithms provide an alternative method of prediction that may contribute, with an automated process and insights, to the diagnosis and classification of the severity level of dementia. The aim of this study is to explore the use of neuropsychological data from a reduced version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) to predict absence or different levels of dementia severity using the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) scores through the implementation of the kNN machine learning algorithm. A sample of 1164 elderly people over sixty years old were evaluated using a reduced version of the ACE-III and the GDS. The kNN classifier provided good accuracies using 15 items from the ACE-III and adequately differentiating people with absence and mild impairment, from those with more severe levels of impairment according to the GDS rating. Our results suggest that the kNN algorithm may be used to automate aspects of clinical cognitive impairment classification in the elderly population.
